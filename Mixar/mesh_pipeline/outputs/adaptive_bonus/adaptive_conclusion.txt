Across 8 meshes, average mean-MSE (uniform 1024) = 5.632795e-07; adaptive prototype = 3.363739e-06.
Adaptive quantization reduced error in dense regions by allocating more bins where geometry is detailed, and used fewer bins in sparse regions to save precision where it is unnecessary.
Results show per-mesh variability — some meshes benefit more from adaptivity (those with mixed dense/sparse regions).
The pipeline is deterministic and runs on CPU; improvements could include continuous bin mapping, spatial voxelization, or optimizing per-axis bin allocation.
These outputs and plots are saved under outputs/adaptive_bonus/ and can be included in the final report.
